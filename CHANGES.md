# Drop Rates
## Gems
Gems are used in a lot of recipes, and in and of themselves as equipment buffs. But not only are gems themselves rare, but you can hardly get the right one.

Gems drop rates have been significantly increased by adding them to the "junk" class of tresure (that spawns scrolls, keys, arrows, and bolts). In Act 1, gems will drop at about 1/4 the rate of arrows and bolts. From Act 2 onwards, they drop at roughly 5/8 the rate.

From Act 2 onwards, 2 kinds of gems drop: one of lower quality and one of higher quality (one grade above the current). The lower quality gem drops 80% of the time, the rest is the higher quality gem. In Act 2 this is chipped and flawed. In Act 3 it's flawed and normal. In Act 4 it's normal and flawless. Then in Act 5 and all higher difficulties, it's flawless and perfect.

### Poison Javelin / Plague Javelin
Poison and Plague Javelin are highly similar to each other. Thus, players will tend to only use the one that deals the most damage.

This mod mixes up the two so that they have different purposes:

1. Poison Javelin is a direct attack spell and an alternative to lightning bolt. It's meant to deliver a large amount of poison damage in a small amount of time.
2. Plague Javelin is a support crowd control spell. It's meant to poison a large number of enemies in a single application. The poison will deal some damage over a long period of time.

Thus the following changes were made:

1. Poison Javelin deals .375 to 0.5625 damage per frame (9.375 to 14/sec) and lasts 2 seconds. At level 1, this counts for 18-28 damage.
2. Plague Javelin deals .3125 to 0.5 damage per frame (7.8125 to 12.5/sec) but lasts 8 seconds and has a larger area. At level 1, this counts for 62-100 damage.
3. Poison Javelin recast delay removed. It is now an alternative to lightning bolt.

Plague Javelin is weaker in absolute damage, but it hits more enemies with poison and lasts longer. Poison Javelin
