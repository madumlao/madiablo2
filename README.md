# What this is about

Nearly 2 decades ago, I first played Diablo 2.

I loved it. It was an insanely enjoyable experience to sink countless hours into. And so I did.

Nearly 2 decades later, I'm now in my 30s. I'm the co-founder and senior developer at a software company. I need countless hours to hone and sharpen my skills, deal with project stress, clients, and kids. Oh I have kids now. Not exactly my kids - my 2 half-sisters and less than 1 year old nephew - but I'm taking care of them due to circumstances. And I need to take care of myself better, pay bills, round off my habits and hobbies, read a ton, write a bit, socialize and so on.

I no longer have countless hours to throw into a game.

Recently, one of my sisters discovered Diablo 2. I remembered it. I miss it. It's great for quality time.

But let's face it, the game was built to be a timesink. Countless hundreds of hours are needed to get the right skills, find the right gear, etc... time that I no longer have the freedom to spend.

So I decided to mod the game.

I'm not going for thoroughly game-breaking experience. I don't want to oneshot UberDiablo, summon a million CowKings, or cast 10 high-level spells on every hit. I just want a slightly more convenient game that doesn't waste what little I have left for family and relaxation.

Take dungeon runs, for example. Why do we even do them? Well pretty much... the reason we do dungeon runs is because we're both grinding and hunting for higher-level magic items. But at the current rates of Diablo item drops, you need upwards of a few dozen boss runs to get a set of high-level equipment. I don't want to encourage this kind of behavior in the kids, or myself. At the same time, I don't want the drop rate to be so high that every drop is a rare or  better - I want there to be the unexpected surprise that comes with random drops.

The likelihood of getting a higher level rune drop is on the order 0.001%. Jesus Christ, this means you need to fight 100000 monsters to get to 10% drop rate. And even then the rune itself isn't what you're looking for, but its partners to make a high level runeword. Simply not gonna stand for this. A decent playthrough should be able to grant you the chance of getting a few high level runewords.

I'm also thinking of some rebalancing. The other big timewaster is in the pivoting of skills. Basically, my opinion is that if Blizzard puts it in as a skill, then there should be a viable strategy using that as the skill. However, Big B put in a lot of dead ends and suboptimal stuff that takes again hundreds of hours of playtesting for players to discover they've just been wasting their time. I won't stand for that either.

Anyways, that's the spirit of what I'm trying to accomplish. Basically, I want a game the delivers the full experience of Diablo 2 without wasting my time.

# How to install

1. Drop the 'data' directory into your Diablo 2 folder. (If you're running a mod such as PlugY, which runs from its own directory, then drop  the 'data' directory into that directory instead.
2. Edit your Game.exe or equivalent shortcut and add the ' -direct -txt' parameters at the end of the line.
3. ????
4. Profit

# How we're testing it

I'm literally making this up as I go along, using only my game design instincts, and my and my sister's experience. This does, of course, mean that most of my attention and rebalancing will be on characters we are playing. If I haven't gotten around to fixing sorc, barb, or pally stuff - that's the main reason.

So far my sister's been enjoying it, and the game feels like a real challenge and experience rather than a god-mode walk.

This also means that this mod is _not_ intended for PvP balancing, but rather for cooperative / party experience.
